# Goal

Learn some new languages by creating calculators.

# Overview

We'll start with a basic calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Over time, we'll do scientific, financial, and then graphing calculators.

# Requirements
### Phase 1: Basic Needs

* **Basic Operations**: The calculator must perform the four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Result Display**: After computing the result, the calculator should display it clearly and then prompt the user for another input. This allows for continuous use until the user decides to exit.
* **Exit Capability**: Users should be able to exit the program using a specific command (e.g., 'exit' or 'quit').
* **Error Handling**: Implement basic error handling for unexpected or malformed inputs to prevent the program from crashing.
* **Instructions for Use**: When the program starts, it should display instructions on how to use the calculator, including the format of the input and how to exit.

### Phase 2: Testing

* **Unit Testing**: Provide unit testing for each tool/language.

### Phase 3: Expanded Features

* **Handling Division by Zero**: The program should handle attempts to divide by zero appropriately, providing an error message instead of crashing or producing a nonsensical result.
* **Repeat Calculations**: The calculator should allow users to perform multiple calculations sequentially without needing to restart the program.
* **Enhanced Console UI**: Provide a cleaner UI with support for arrow keys, etc.
* **User Input Validation**: The program should validate user inputs to ensure they are numerical values where expected and handle non-numerical inputs gracefully, either by rejecting them or by displaying an error message.
* **Floating Point Arithmetic**: The calculator should support floating-point arithmetic to allow for more precise calculations with decimals.
* **Variables**: Support for variables, e.g., A=1, B=1+A ... displays: 2

### Phase 4: Web Server

* **Web Interface**: Should provide a basic HTTP server that accepts input and responds with the calculator result.
* **Unit Testing**: Unit testing should be updated.
* **UI Testing**: UI testing to ensure proper handling of input, etc.
